# SQL-Capstone-Project
This repository focusses on the main capstone project by Coursera for the course: [SQL for Data Science (and Version Control with GitHub)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science-and-version-control-with-github/).

# Link to project
The final project is uploaded in this repository as [Project.ipynb](https://github.com/yosefemshani/SQL-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Project.ipynb).

### Aim of this project
A real-world data analysis challenge is simulated using a dataset from TechMart, a growing retail chain. All used datasets and tables can be found in this repository. Credits to Coursera for the simulated datasets.

## 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
This is highly relevant to analyze in this simulated dataset for real-life application of Data Science and Data Analysis, due to the fact that realistic complex datasets show messy data, which needs cleaning before analysis.

## 2. Data Analysis
SQL queries using basic search selects to more advanced joins and subqueries will be applied. Furthermore, aggregation techniques to summarize data and uncover trends are used.

## 3. Data Report
Finally, after cleaning and analyzing given data, a report is given to summarize the analysis procedure and show the results of mentioned data analysis. This is important for this simulated company TechMart to further work on it's growth by making data-driven decisions.
